DEREK IN PROGRESS
-----------------
* adding structure class - DONE, but no destruction functionality


CORE
----

* make wrapper class for vectors of units?
	-> document UnitManager after

* document GameLoop

* Fix unit behavior so that clumps of units move properly (definitely has something to do with repathing) 
	-> remove or rework repathing
		-> only repath if the unit is stuck
	-> lags in debug version
	-> looks a little messyn in large groups
	-> perhaps add some group movement stuff
	-> allow them to pathfind to structures

* AI improvements
	-> fix reset issues
	-> seperate functions for AI target chasing and finding
	-> regular checks for closer targets
	-> choose new target every round?

* remove code duplication and clean code
	-> unit manager is in need of some work
	-> the event loop is starting to get messy with all the game states flying around

* add more subclasses for different units

* make game settings centralized (such as scroll speed) and easy to change
	-> should they be in a file outside the code?

* improve maps
	-> allow them to have more tile types
	-> maybe make a unique file type
	-> make it easier to make and change them

* display options
	-> add fullscreen option in game (in code just need to add flag to SDL_CreateWindow)
	-> add zoom in and out
	-> add resolution options (SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP is a useful flag)

* add button to start screen (new button class?)

* add win/lose condition and game over trigger (simple--all units dead)

GRAPHICAL
---------
* indicate move and attack commands with visual response

* make cursor for in game

* make health bars always top layer

* implement better line drawing algorithm for more versatility (like dda)

* improve units
	-> perhaps change selection circles to be nicer (research other games)
	-> add a gradual walking animation instead of tile by tile jumps
	-> add sprites for dead and bloodied units
	-> nicer health bars

* add a GUI

* proper tileset

DEBUG
-----
* fix delay at start of match - DONE?

* unit starting in the top left (right?) corner of map breaks game

* make some unit tests for various classes

EXTERNAL
--------
* make image that shows the overall heirarchy of code

ADDITIONAL
----------
* add reset to Timer
